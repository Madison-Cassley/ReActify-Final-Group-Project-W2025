## Definition of “good enough” for this project

*What would the team collectively consider “good enough” of an achievement for the project?*

For our team, 'good enough' means delivering a stable and functional application that fulfills all specified requirements while ensuring clear communication and teamwork. As long as we put in the effort to complete our tasks, address any issues that arise in a timely manner, and avoid major miscommunications, we will consider our project a success. Meeting the minimum requirements to achieve a good grade is important, but our focus is also on working efficiently as a team.

## Division of work

*How will each member contribute to the project?*

- A: I will be working on the hardware setup and helping with the MAUI app development. 
- B: I will be working on the backend logic for the most part.
- C: For the time being the work is not fully planned out but I would like to do a mix of front and back end + working on the hardware.

## Frequency of communication

*How often will the team be in touch and what tools will be used to communicate?*

Our primary communication platform will be Discord, where we will discuss and coordinate most of our work. Snapchat will serve as an alternative for quick check-ins, calls, or casual updates. We plan to stay in touch frequently throughout the week, aiming for at least three times when needed. 

## Response delays

*What is a reasonable delay to reply to messages? Is it the same for weekdays and weekends?*

For normal communications, a response delay of up to 2-3 days is reasonable. In urgent cases, such as when a milestone is due within 24-48 hours, responses should ideally be within 2 hours when possible. However, we understand that everyone has different schedules and workloads, so as long as progress is communicated and work is being completed, we won’t be overly strict about exact response times.

## Receiving feedback

*How do you prefer to receive feedback? Each member must provide a sample sentence for how they would like to receive constructive feedback from their peers.*

*(If unsure, assume a hypothetical situation such as you have not completed your work in time or you have not replied to a message in a timely manner).*

- A: I prefer feedback to be clear and direct, without vagueness or misleading comments. It should not be hostile or forceful. If something needs significant changes, especially if it’s close to the deadline and isn’t just a small fix, I would rather be informed earlier to have enough time to adjust. Constructive feedback should focus on solutions rather than just pointing out issues. For example: “Heads-up: [issue] could affect [outcome]. If possible, can we address it before the deadline? If not, we can discuss alternatives. Let me know what you think.”

- B: I would like to receive feedback in a constructive manner. If there’s anything that can be improved, I would like to receive it in a manner that does not offend my work and that will promote me to consider where I can do better. For example: “It’s good that you have implemented A. I also do think that if you took some time to implement B, and within the timeframe that would permit you, it will make the app better.”

- C: I would like to receive calm but clear feedback, if it’s for something negative I would like it to be formatted as such “Hey, so I have noticed that [insert problem here] which is causing [insert consequences here] it would be much better/really helpful if you could [insert proposed solution here]” There should be room for conversation, not just flat out anger/disrespect.

## In case of conflict

*If a team member fails to communicate as described in this contract or does not respond to constructive feedback, what measures should the other teammate take?*

If a team member doesn’t respond or communicate as expected, we will follow up up to three times. For small issues, this gives them a chance to reply and resolve things. If it’s a bigger problem affecting progress, we will discuss it as a team. If needed, we will involve the teacher as a last resort.
